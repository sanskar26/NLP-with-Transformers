# NLP-with-Transformers
Project part of Summer of Code IIT Bombay,2021
The first week started with getting familiar with pytorch, implementing basic tensor operations, a feed forward neural network for classification task on CIFAR- dataset. Along, with that we got introduced to a very powerful library in python "nltk" which provides utilities functions for data preprocessing/cleaning task such as removing stopwords, punctuations, html tags, url(links), Stemming and Lemmatization , tokenisation of corpus, etc. Since i was already familiar with Neural Networks, Backpropagation(the technique used to update the weight using gradient descent optimisation algorithm). Since a computer program cannot take string/word as input, the corpus of text used to training must be converted into numeric form which is done using word vector/embedding. For the first task where we were asked to code a feed forward neural net model for Sentiment analysis( Classification Task) on IMDB moview review dataseet from kaggle, i started by first importing and conducting Exploratory data Analysis(EDA) and got the gist of the data distribution
