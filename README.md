# NLP-with-Transformers
### Project part of Summer of Code IIT Bombay, 2021
\
The first week started with getting familiar with pytorch, implementing basic tensor operations, a feed forward neural network for classification task on CIFAR- dataset. Along, with that we got introduced to a very powerful library in python "nltk" which provides utilities functions for data preprocessing/cleaning task such as removing stopwords, punctuations, html tags, url(links), Stemming and Lemmatization , tokenisation of corpus, etc. Since i was already familiar with Neural Networks, Backpropagation(the technique used to update the weight using gradient descent optimisation algorithm). Since a computer program cannot take string/word as input, the corpus of text used to training must be converted into numeric form which is done using word vector/embedding.

For the first task where we were asked to code a feed forward neural net model for Sentiment analysis( Classification Task) on IMDB moview review dataseet from kaggle, i started by first importing and conducting Exploratory data Analysis(EDA) and got the gist of the data distribution,and found that the target classes where equally distributed, hence we didn't need to undersample or oversample the data instances for an accurate model. Then used nltk and re library for preprocessing task, Started with a 2 hidden layer neural net with 500 neurons each,have used the cross entropy loss function and Adaptive momenta optmiser for back propagation of the loss and updating the parameters, weight and biases of the network.
